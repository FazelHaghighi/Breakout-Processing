This is AP final project that is developing breakout game.
I did some additional works in my game such as changing the color of blocks by every crushed them with ball and_
changing background of game with every touch of keyboard(no matter that witch one it) and then speed of ball with 
every mousePressed(right click for falling speed && left click for rising speed).
and also i didn't override some necessary proceeding for this game like items that when ball crushed some blocks 
some thing as a gift fall down and you give them with paddle as extra score.
